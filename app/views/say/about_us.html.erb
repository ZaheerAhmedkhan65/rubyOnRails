    </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="lead"><strong>Practical Learning</strong>: Our teaching approach focuses on practical skills, not just theory. Each week, our students work on assignments related to the topic covered, which they upload to their GitHub repositories for review.</li>
        
        <li class="lead"><strong>Industry Experience</strong>: As a growing software house, we work on real-world projects that help businesses transform their ideas into digital solutions. Our students benefit from this industry exposure, learning not only how to code but also how to collaborate and problem-solve in real-world environments.</li>

    <h2>About Our Web Development Course</h2>

    <p class="lead">
        Our web development course is designed to equip students with the skills they need to succeed in today’s tech-driven world. We cover the full spectrum of web development, from frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to backend development and database management. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the fundamentals or someone aiming to deepen your skills, our course offers a structured, project-based approach to learning.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        <strong>Weekly Classes</strong>: Our classes are held every Saturday and are completely free to attend. Each class focuses on a specific topic within web development, from basic HTML structuring to more advanced topics like JavaScript frameworks, API integration, and responsive design. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation to build full-stack web applications.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        <strong>Assignments and Real-World Projects</strong>: We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. After each session, students are given an assignment related to the topic covered. These assignments mimic real-world scenarios and are meant to reinforce the skills they’ve learned. Students then submit their work through GitHub, where we review their code and provide feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>Managing Student Progress</h2>

    <p class="lead">
        This platform is designed to help us manage and review student work efficiently. Each student has their own GitHub repository where they upload their assignments. We have created a simple and effective interface that links directly to these repositories, allowing us to review submissions, track progress, and give feedback on each student's performance.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        The repository links make it easy for both students and instructors to keep track of assignments and ensure that all work is up to date. By using GitHub as the submission platform, students also get valuable experience in version control—a critical skill in the modern development workflow.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
        Our goal is not just to teach you how to code but also to give you the tools and experience you need to thrive in a professional environment. From learning to collaborate on projects to understanding how to push code updates effectively, our course prepares you for the real world.
    </p>
